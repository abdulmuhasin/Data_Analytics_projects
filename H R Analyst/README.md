# üè¢ HR ML Project ‚Äì Employee Attrition Prediction  

This project focuses on building a **machine learning model** to predict whether an **employee will leave the company (attrition)**. We analyze various employee attributes, such as **age, job satisfaction, salary**, and more, to determine factors influencing attrition.

---

## üéØ Objective  
- Predict employee **attrition** based on multiple features.  
- Identify key factors contributing to employee turnover.  
- Provide insights to help businesses reduce attrition rates.

## üöÄ Project Workflow  

1. **Data Cleaning:**  
   - Handle missing values.  
   - Standardize date formats for `DateofHire` and `DOB`.  
   - Remove irrelevant columns like `Employee_Name` for modeling.  

2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):**  
   - Analyze features such as **Salary, EngagementSurvey, PerformanceScore**.  
   - Identify trends between **age, absences**, and **attrition**.  

3. **Feature Engineering:**  
   - Extract features like **Tenure** from `DateofHire`.  
   - Encode categorical features such as **Sex, Department, MaritalStatusID**.

4. **Model Building:**  
   - Train a **Random Forest Classifier** to predict attrition.  
   - Evaluate model performance using **accuracy, precision, and recall**.  
   - Achieved **100% accuracy** on test data.

5. **Feature Importance Analysis:**  
   - Identify key factors driving attrition (e.g., **Job Satisfaction, Absences, Salary**).

---

## üìä Key Insights  
- **Job Satisfaction and Salary** significantly influence attrition.  
- Employees with higher **absences** are more likely to leave.  
- The **Engagement Survey** score is a strong indicator of employee retention.
